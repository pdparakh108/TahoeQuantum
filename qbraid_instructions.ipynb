    "Qbraid will give you an environment in which we can run the challenge notebook, and will have an environment created that includes the packages you need. Qbraid also gives you the ability to run experiments on actual quantum computers easily. To get started, first make an account with [Qbraid](https://www.qbraid.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you make an account, from the homepage, click \"Manage\" next to where it says \"Plan: Free\". Then, where it says \"Access Key\", use the code ***EHNU6626*** and press submit. This should give you 500 credits that you can use to run the actual quantum computers. \n",

    "To open a Jupyter Notebook, under the \"Compute\" tab, select \"Free 2vCPU 4GB RAM\", then click \"Launch Lab\", and then click \"My Server\". This should take you to an interface with a terminal, a file tree, and an environemnt manager. Downlaod the files from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pdparakh108/TahoeQuantum.git), and upload them to Qbraid. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now set up the environment needed to run the notebook. Under \"Environments\", click \"Add\". Then, search for \"Tahoe Quantum\", and press \"Install\". Once the environment is installed, you should be able to see it in your available kernels to use. \n",

    "Then, you can open the Jupyter Notebook with the challenge, select the \"Tahoe Quantum\" kernel from the top right hand corner, and you should be able to run the entire notebook!\n"
